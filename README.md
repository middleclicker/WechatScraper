# Wechat Scraper

Wechat Scraper is a tool for collecting and analyzing your Wechat chat history. Windows only.

## Project Status
I'll finish it after the exams lol

## Installation

Wechat Scraper runs with the following dependencies
```
matplotlib==3.5.1
plotly==5.6.0
psutil==5.9.0
psutil==5.8.0
pywinauto==0.6.8
wordcloud==1.9.1.1
```
You can install them manually or from the requirements.txt file
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/middleclicker/WechatScraper.git
```
2. Edit variables in `mindful.py`
- CHATNAME is the alias you gave to the contact / group chat. You have to change this for the program to run.
- SCROLLS is the number of times the program will scroll up. You do not have to change this.
```python
# Variables
CHATNAME = "Â∞èÁãêÁã∏ü¶ä"
SCROLLS = 500
```
3. Open WeChat and open the chat history box. Make sure it stays as the topmost app with no other windows covering it. I suggest using DeskPins to do this.
4. Open a command prompt and cd to the WechatScraper directory. Run `mindful.py`
```bash
python3 mindful.py
```
5. Wait for the program to finish. You should see a CSV file generated in the directory.
6. Run `combine.py` to combine your different scrapes and remove duplicates. This will generate a `combined.csv`. If you don't have multiple .csv files (multiple scrapes), don't run the file and rename your CSV file to `combined.csv`.
```bash
python3 combine.py
```
7. Run `dataminer.py` to extract information from the `combined.csv` file. The processed data should appear in `/data` directory. Two browser tabs should open displaying the graphs. If you are not happy with the color schemes, simply rerun the program to randomize the color schemes again. You can download the graphs as a PNG file by clicking on the download button.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. A version for MacOS would be amazing (I have no idea how to do that).
